    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps us get a basic understanding of the components of the MPI dataset that will be used in this project. Here we are only interested in the NC subset becuase it contains the resting-state scans that were followed by the short NYCQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will generate the following output files in the ```Resources``` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```SNYCQ_Preproc.csv```: dataframe with responses to SNYCQ administered only following resting state scans. Subjects with no responses have been removed. Data re-sorted so there is one row per scan (693) and one column per question (12). New meaningful labels for each quesion.\n",
    "* ```NC_sbj_rest_and_snycq.txt```: text file with the list of subjects that have at least one resting-state scan with SNYCQ answers. These deserve attempting pre-processing of their anatomical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```NC_anat_info.csv```: table with information regarding the location of the anatomical data for each subject. This is necessary becuase the anatomical scan was not acquired on the same session for all subjects.\n",

    "### s-NYCQ: When was it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The s-NYCQ was administered in 7 different occasions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prior to entering the scanner**: 'pre-ses-02'\n",
    "* **After each of the 4 resting-state scans**: 'post-ses-02-run-02-acq-AP', 'post-ses-02-run-02-acq-PA', 'post-ses-02-run-01-acq-AP', 'post-ses-02-run-01-acq-PA'\n",
    "* **After a couple of computerized tasks**: ('post-ses-02-task-ETS','post-ses-02-task-CPTS').\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use only the questionnaires administered following each resting state scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### s-NYCQ: Content/Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Desciption of the sNYCQ - as described in <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018307'>Mendes et al. (2019)</a>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* sNYCQ is similar to NYC-Q, but only includes 12 questions (instead of 31).\n",
    "* sNYCQ also attempts to measure the form and content of mind-wandering.\n",
    "* sNYCQ was administered digitally (while in the scanner) using a digital format of a scale bar:\n",
    "    * Resolution = increments of 5%\n",
    "    * 0% = \"describes my thoughts not at all\"\n",
    "    * 100% = \"describes my thoughts completely\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>NOTE</u>**: Although <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018307'>Mendes et al. (2019)</a> mentions that this shorter version of the NYC-Q was previosly used by <a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077554'>Ruby et al. (2013)</a>, that is not correct. Ruby et al. only used 9 questions (not 12 as in here), and their questions were about content and mood, which is an additional difference.\n",

    "### MPI-Dataset: Subject / Scan counts\n",
    "\n",
    "* MPI Mind-Brain-Body Dataset total number of subjects: 318*\n",
    "* LEMON (ses-01) number of subjects: 228 subjects\n",
    "* N&C (ses-02) number of subjects: 199 subjects** \n",
    "    * 194 subjects with 4 runs: (Not listed)\n",
    "    * 3   subjects with 3 runs: 010029, 010083, 010133\n",
    "    * 1   subjects with 2 runs: 010087\n",
    "    * 1   subjects with 1 runs: 010180\n",
    "    * 5   subjects with 0 scans: 010020, 010032, 010061, 010079 and 010081 (see note 2 below)\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>NOTE 1</u>**: There is overlap between the two samples. That is why the total is not 228 + 199 = 427\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>NOTE 2</u>**: Despite SNYCQ answers being available in the SNYCQ table for subjects 010020, 010032, 010061, 010079 and 010081; there is not fMRI data for session 02 for these subjects. The fact that SNYCQ answers exists suggest those scans were acquired (as the SNYCQ contains responses about the thoughts during the scans); yet the associated fMRI scans are nowhere to be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: \n",
    "* There is fMRI data for (194 sbjs * 4 scans/sbjs) + (3 sbjs * 3 scans/sbjs) + (1 sbj * 2 scans/sbj) + (1 sbj * 1scan/sbj) = 788 resting-state scans\n",
    "* <u>But not all scans have a completed sNYCQ. The questionnaire was only recorded following only 693 runs (out of the 788 available) </u> (see <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018307/tables/3'>Table 2 in Mendes et al. 2019</a>).
